📘 Project Title: Kaggle Notebook Analysis
📌 Description
This project is a comprehensive data science analysis performed using Kaggle Notebooks and presented in Jupyter Notebook format. It demonstrates the full data science workflow — from data exploration and cleaning to model building and evaluation.

Key highlights of the notebook include:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical insights to understand data distribution, outliers, and relationships.

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Handling of missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.

🤖 Model Training: Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or others.

📈 Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, and visual validation tools like confusion matrices and ROC curves.

📂 Kaggle Dataset: The dataset used is sourced directly from Kaggle and is available here (Add your dataset link here).
